About

Pop-up translate is an extension for Google Chrome browser aimed to help you
quickly translate selected text. Unlike most of similar extensions, it uses Bing
Translator API instead of Google Translate API, so it will continue working after
01.12.2011 when Google will close it's translation API for free usage.
